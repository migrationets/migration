I'm a mexican living in a New England town and yesterday I experienced one of the strangest feelings in my life which I think is worth sharing.
While seeing the performance of a @mdmanzanales coreography by the @BalletHispanico at the local theater I was trying to internalize the difference of how she and I percive our mexicanity and thus identity in such different ways.
The public at the theater cheered constantly and I could tell that they embrace latino culture and plurality in general which reinforced my feeling of being nothing but welcomed since I moved here.
Then the familiar chords of "México" by @IMS_MIS started playing and this great upbeat song together with the mexican inspired dance moves and costumes made everyone excited and more than one joined the dance in their seats.
It was an absolute party of joy in the place for everyone, not for me. This song is about the narco-government in Mexico and how the drug empire has taken and bleed my country.
The whole 40 minute walk from the theater to my place I listened to the song, trying to make it lose sense in my mind as when you repeat the same word a thousand times. But it had the opposite effect.
It's worth noting that yesterday was 4/20 and that I woke up to the news of 13 persons killed at a family party in Minatitlán, Veracruz - one of them a 1 year old whose father was also murder trying to protect him.
Then it all made sense, the dance, the song's lyrics (which also mentions deaths in Veracruz), the party, the 4/20, everything. Absolutely everything yesterday was connected.
This is an uneven party where one country puts the fun and the other one the bodies.
I don't urge you to understand spanish or any other language but to understand that drug abuse is not a country isolated public health problem but one with great consequences in other regions.
Better migration policies are a must but won't do nothing if we don't understand why people is migrating and what can be done to improve that situation.
